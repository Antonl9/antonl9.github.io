            <p class="title">The Transfiguration School</p>
            <p class="apple">Every child of immigrants has been criticized for their lack of proficiency in their parents' mother tongue, most often by their parents themselves.</p>
            <p class="apple">Every Saturday morning, around 7 AM, a wave of Chinese-American families take to the deserted streets of Brooklyn, hopping in the B train and quietly passing the bridge to turn back to what seems for a moment their homeland, Chinatown. This is what I did for two years, accompanied by my mother. Chinatown is a place of its own, hidden behind the massive skyscrapers that built Manhattan. Chinatown is a place whose culture stands beyond any building ever made. Its streets are lined with stalls of durian and bok choy, so unfamiliar to Americans and yet so familiar in my community. I often passed the Tai Chi park, the local bakery bun shops, and markets with fresh fish. The Transfiguration School, a Catholic school on weekdays, is in the center of the neighborhood. Austere and uninspiring, the school does not scream Chinese culture like the rest of Chinatown. There are no lanterns or century-old drawings; the school fails to emblem the history that China and its dynasty had to tell. Yet, every Saturday morning from 7:30 AM to 2 PM, this was my home.</p>
            <p class="apple">We would open our textbooks, drawn in by the strokes of the Chinese characters, and begin reciting the basic vocabulary. Often, some students would raise their hand asking for the PinYin Version, a Mandarin language in an English alphabet writing, and the teachers would look on in disappointment, a reminder of the existing barrier. With a mix of broken Mandarin and English, we would converse with each other, trying to remember words we had just learned. After the morning, writing and reading came for lunch. It was the time when we could finally distance ourselves and return to the English language. None of us wanted to be there; five hours of school on a Sunday is no child's idea of a weekend. </p>
            <p class="apple">During the celebration of the Chinese New Year, the streets of Chinatown would turn into a riot of color, with the sound of drums and the sharp scent of firecrackers lingering in the cool February air. Family and friends flock to the school to celebrate. We would be met with the sweet smell of dumplings, stir-fried noodles, and other traditional dishes families had brought for the celebration. While we might have been distanced from our parents' culture, food brought us closer. The students would run around tasting everything in sight and begging for seconds and thirds. For the parents, the celebration was a place of communal gathering. They shared stories of their childhood back home, reminiscing on the foods and culture and, at times, complaining about the quality of life in NYC. </p>
            <p class="apple">At the end of the year, the school hosted a graduation ceremony for all the classes. Students were all asked to perform in front of all the parents and other classes. My class was tasked to recite an old poem that spoke about virtue and truth. Upon entering the vast, filled auditorium,  one could see the proud look of all the parents as they stuck out their phones to record their children. Our Chinese might have been clunky, our pronunciation not just right. But to our parents and many others, the fact that their children were able to engage in the culture of their own was just enough. </p>
            <p class="apple">As a child of immigrants, navigating through the complexities of two cultures in a city that demands to know one's identity can be a constant struggle. However, the struggles we encounter are nothing compared to the experiences of the parents who made the sacrifice to immigrate. They left behind their culture, family, and home for the sake of their children's well-being. The unfamiliar noise of a foreign tongue, the labyrinthine streets that twist like the cultural differences they navigate daily, each step is a testament to their courage. Yet, what they struggle with most is when visiting their homeland and seeing their children unable to speak the language, un-immersed in their culture, and wishing to return to the US. Ultimately, for immigrant parents, assimilating to a new world comes at the cost of leaving parts of their culture behind. For my Chinese community, the school was a testament to the immigrant spirit of New York City. The city that does not erase all identities but allows them to coexist and create a symphony of cultures, all uniquely American.</p>
